# gender-classification
## Introduction
Gender is a significant analysis in many real-life applications, including Customer Care and National Crime Intelligence. Many experiments and multiple broad data sets are based on a single face picture in the Gender Classification. Neural networks, which showed good efficiency, are commonly used in these studies. In this project, therefore, we would like to discuss the gender of the photos by three different ways of looking at CNN, KNN and SVM.

## Dataset
We use the well-know dataset "Labeled Faces in the Wild Home" from University of Massachusetts Amherst, http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/
